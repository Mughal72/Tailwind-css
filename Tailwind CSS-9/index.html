<!-- The ‘@apply’ directive
The ‘@apply’ directive feature is used to apply a number of classes to an individual custom class. With this approach, the HTML code doesn’t get bloated with a lot of classes. Instead, it would be amazing if one can extract these different classes into an external selector using tailwind. Hence, You can use the @apply directive to replace the mess of utility classes with a single custom class. Let’s understand this with an example-

 

Why use the @apply directive? - Create Button

To understand the use of the @apply directive, You can first create and add different Tailwind Utility classes to an element such as a button. As a result, a single component uses a lot of classes and therefore to use the identical component in the project you have to use all those classes on the button element once again. This approach of replicating the element will hamper the development experience. Therefore, To overcome this issue Tailwind provides the feature of the ‘@apply’ directive. 

 

Using @apply directive

First of all, You need to cut all the classes of the button element and replace it with an individual custom class. For example, All the utility classes of the button are replaced by the ‘btn’ class. After that, You can target the created class with a selector in your global CSS and paste the utility classes inside it -->
