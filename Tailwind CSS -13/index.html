<!-- Production Build
The production build forms the minified bundles of the application with optimized assets to enhance the loading time of the application in the client’s device. Thus, The Production build allows you to deploy the application in a staging environment. 

Initiating the Production
One can use the Vite to install the application for production. You can easily install Vite by using the ‘npm install Vite’ command. Moreover, In package.json, make sure to add Vite in the build command to start building the application for production 

Overview - ‘Dist’ Folder
Eventually, You have to open the dist folder with VS code. After that, Open the application with the help of a live server extension as it launches a development local server with the live reload feature. Remember that all the files, including assets, in the dist folder constitute your website. Now, One can easily deploy the website in Vultr, Digital ocean, Github, Linode etc by submitting the Dist Folder. You can check out our previous tutorial on how to deploy a static website by clicking here.

Overview - ‘Assets’ Folder
The asset folder includes all the files, such as CSS, JS, image etc in a very neatly minified form. This is so because the files have been optimised for production. These files are optimized in such a way that it consumes the minimum amount of bandwidth of the client while loading and surfing through the website. For example, the CSS file will be extremely minified and only the used utility classes will be available in the CSS file. As a result, the size of the CSS file will decrease considerably. -->
