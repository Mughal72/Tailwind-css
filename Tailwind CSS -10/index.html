<!-- Tailwind will automatically move the CSS within any @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule, so you don’t have to worry about authoring your CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues.

Any custom CSS added to a layer will only be included in the final build if that CSS is actually used in your HTML, just like all of the classes built in to Tailwind by default.

Wrapping any custom CSS with @layer also makes it possible to use modifiers with those rules, like hover: and focus: or responsive modifiers like md: and lg:. 

In Tailwind CSS, the @layer directive indicates which "bucket" a set of custom styles belong to. It can help organize CSS and allows users to create custom classes as part of the three fundamental layers. 
Valid layers include components, utilities, and base. Tailwind automatically moves any CSS within a @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule. This means that users don't need to worry about writing their CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues. 
Here's an example of how to use the @layer directive:
Use the @layer directive
Copy everything

Call it btn-test
Dump it next to apply
Use all of the stuff that you could do in html
Save both files
On the front end, have a new css class called btn.test using all of the tailwind utility styles
The button should still look the same-->


<!-- Disadvantages of using Directives

As per my experience, The amount of classes in a single element is one of the major concerns in Tailwind CSS. While using Tailwind, A number of classes are added to each of the HTML elements. Thus, The tailwind CSS has provided the feature of @apply and @layer directive but this benefit comes with a price. By using directive, You are actually shifting the maintainability of the application to the global CSS file.

For example, You have created a button and shifted all the utility classes in a custom ‘btn’ class in the global CSS file. In that case, You have to revisit the global CSS file repeatedly. Thus, It will be hindering your developer experience and would become similar to writing Traditional CSS.

 

When to Use Directives?

Eventually, You must use directives when you are in a situation to reuse the components multiple times in your application. Otherwise, If you are creating a component for single-use then you must avoid using the directives. Moreover, while using apply directive one must make sure to choose the custom class name very wisely to avoid any confusion in the future. For example, You can use the ‘btn’ class name to depict the button. -->
