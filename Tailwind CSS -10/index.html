<!-- Tailwind will automatically move the CSS within any @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule, so you donâ€™t have to worry about authoring your CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues.

Any custom CSS added to a layer will only be included in the final build if that CSS is actually used in your HTML, just like all of the classes built in to Tailwind by default.

Wrapping any custom CSS with @layer also makes it possible to use modifiers with those rules, like hover: and focus: or responsive modifiers like md: and lg:. 

In Tailwind CSS, the @layer directive indicates which "bucket" a set of custom styles belong to. It can help organize CSS and allows users to create custom classes as part of the three fundamental layers. 
Valid layers include components, utilities, and base. Tailwind automatically moves any CSS within a @layer directive to the same place as the corresponding @tailwind rule. This means that users don't need to worry about writing their CSS in a specific order to avoid specificity issues. 
Here's an example of how to use the @layer directive:
Use the @layer directive
Copy everything
Call it btn-test
Dump it next to apply
Use all of the stuff that you could do in html
Save both files
On the front end, have a new css class called btn.test using all of the tailwind utility styles
The button should still look the same-->
